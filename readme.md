# React AJAX Lab

### Exercise

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

The goal in this lab is to integrate with the [Giphy API](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI).

Use the starter code provided to build out an app that loads and displays animated gifs from Giphy.

### Requirements

When your app loads it should pull in 16 random gifs to populate the UI. (Just use a random search string like 'cats' or something similar).

- Add a form which allows the user to search for gifs based on a specific search term.

- When the form is submitted the currently displayed gifs should be removed before the new ones are added.

- Disable the form while the AJAX request is loading

You will need to get an API key in order to use the API. Don't worry it only takes a moment and is free. Go to the [Developers Portal](https://developers.giphy.com/) and click the **Create an App** button to get started.

### Bonus

- Make a **load more** button which when clicked loads in the next 16 gifs.

### Deliverables

Your site should look something like:
